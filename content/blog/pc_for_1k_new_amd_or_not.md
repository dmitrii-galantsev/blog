AMD Recently released a new CPU family named AMD Zen 4.

It comes with a new socket, integrated graphics, and support for DDR5.

But does it make sense in a somewhat budget build? Let's explore.

TL;DR:  
Yes if you have an extra $100

## [Original list](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/WCszsL)

- Ryzen 7 5700X - $230
- 6650xt - $250
- 32gb DDR4 - $70
Total: $1000

## [New gen list](<https://pcpartpicker.com/list/nxtXpH>)

- **Ryzen 5 7600X** - $300
- **6650 XT** - $250
- 16gb DDR5 - $73
Total: $1102

## CPU

**Ryzen 5 7600X** is [~20%
better](https://nanoreview.net/en/cpu-compare/amd-ryzen-7-5700x-vs-amd-ryzen-5-7600x)
than Ryzen 7 5700X New gen ryzen is better but costs $70 more + new mobo costs
$50 more.

It comes with integrated GPU. Some things can be handled by it instead of the
discrete GPU but I'm not sure how well that works.

The new AM5 socket will be supported for a while, so if you will upgrade the
CPU ever (you probably won't for years) - it's a better decision.

## GPU

- I don't know how good the integrated GPU is - but if you can make that last
  until [December 13th](https://www.gpumag.com/amd-rdna-3/) (new GPU launch
  date) - you can pick up a better deal.
- If not - **Radeon 6650 XT** is a good GPU. At least [twice as
  good](https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/AMD-RX-6650-XT-vs-Nvidia-GTX-1650S-Super/m1845690vs4058)
  as a discrete GTX 1650 Super.

## RAM

- [tomshardware: DDR4 vs DDR5 speed does not
  matter](https://www.tomshardware.com/features/ddr5-vs-ddr4-is-it-time-to-upgrade-your-ram#:~:text=The%20performance%20difference%20in%20gaming,C36%20was%20only%202%25%20faster.)
- AMD Zen 4 does NOT support DDR4. So you can either get less RAM or pay double
  :(
